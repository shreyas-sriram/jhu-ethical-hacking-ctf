# jhu-ethical-hacking-ctf

A Capture the Flag (CTF) machine built for Ethical Hacking (EN.650.631) course at Johns Hopkins University.

> CTF was based on Avengers theme, so you'd probably find Avengers references throughout, which serve as hints. However to pwn the machine, all you need is the IP address of the machine.

Setup instructions are given at [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

Writeup is at [WRITEUP.md](./WRITEUP.md).
